## About me

Howdy, I'm Peter! I'm a junior at the University of Manitoba doing a Honours degree in Computer Science, minoring in Mathematics and Film Studies, and I genuinely love what I do! I always grew up interested in mathematics and programming, and I couldn't have envisioned myself doing anything else. I've dipped my fingers into web development, game development, machine learning, data analytics, cybersecurity, and competitive programming. Every course, project, or work I've taken has been such an exciting journey and there being so much more to learn keeps me going every day. My finish line will be once I've accumulated enough knowledge and can help raise the next generation of CS students to be much greater and capable than I am!

Currently, I'm on the hunt for my first co-op internship starting Summer 2026. I bring with me a data-driven problem solving mindset, technical communication skills, and abilities to quickly spin up proof-of-concepts from my wonderful time as an AI Research/Engineer Intern at PIXTA Vietnam over Summer 2025. I have a preference for Software Developer and Game Programmer roles, especially if I can contribute to an established codebase and get my hands dirty in a fast-paced, constantly shipping environment! You can check out more of my past accomplishments and qualifications in the Experience and Projects sections.

Aside from coding, I also enjoy helping fellow CS students grow, be it through writing student guides published at the Computer Science Students' Association, my Teaching Assistant/Grader gigs or explaining course content to my classmates. If you're a student, do check out my Coursework page for my own resources on how to succeed! I also take competition very seriously; do hit me up if you are looking for hackathon teammates! As for more casual hobbies, I love eating good food, taking extra naps, and watching movies. My favorite franchise currently is Umamusume: Pretty Derby and my GitHub's namesake is Pieberry, the main protagonist of Witch Spring!
